In this project we started exploring vanilla JavaScript which is linked to a Java API. 
We used JPA, H2, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Java Spring MVC model. 
To properly use JavaSript in it's plain form, we utilized a bundler called Parcel to ensure properly run time environment.
We have since moved onto React, however I wish to come back to this project to regression test, and add front end material.
